# --- Sensor triggers ----------------------------------------------------------
#
# A task with recurrence type RECURRENCE_TRIGGER has no calendar schedule of
# its own; instead a new occurrence becomes due when a sensor it is bound to
# satisfies one of the following conditions (mirroring Home Assistant's own
# "state" and "numeric_state" automation triggers):
#   - TASK_TRIGGER_STATE: a binary_sensor (or any entity) reaches a given state.
#   - TASK_TRIGGER_NUMERIC_STATE: a numeric sensor crosses a single threshold,
#     either rising above it ("above") or falling below it ("below"). Exactly
#     one of the two must be set - this is a directional crossing, not a
#     range/band between two bounds.

# --- Member roles / child task confirmation ----------------------------------
#
# A member's role determines whether their completions need parental sign-off:
# when a member with role MEMBER_ROLE_CHILD marks their assigned task done,
# the coordinator does not award points immediately. Instead it opens the
# task's status as TASK_STATUS_AWAITING_CONFIRMATION and creates a single-use
# task (recurrence RECURRENCE_CONFIRMATION, see above) assigned to the
# household's parents. Completing *that* task finalizes the child's
# completion (points + rotation); skipping it rejects the claim and returns
# the original task to its normal pending/overdue state.
